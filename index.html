		<p class="gists">The game 'Huckle Buckle Beanstalk' is commonly known as 'Hot or Cold' game.</p>
		<p class="gists">On start of the game, a randomly generated number is selected by the game between 0 and 100. The player will then attempt to guess the number selected by the game in as little tries as possible. I know what you are thinking, the odds of guessing the correct number is a hundred to one, but don't worry, we have you covered. On each guess you make, there will the a response telling you how close your guess is to the number. A response 'Hot' means you are close, a response 'Cold' means your guess is far from the number and the response 'Warm' means you are somwhere in between.</p>
		<p>Now that you have what you need to play, go ahead and see if you can guess the number!!!</p>
